<h3>Expression:</h3>
<p>An expression in a programming language is a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value.</P>

<p> An expression is every part of code that returns value. Note that in Kotlin every function returns at least Unit, therefore every function invocation is an expression.</p>

<h3>Statment:</h3>
<p> In computer programming, a statement is the smallest standalone element of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out.</P>
